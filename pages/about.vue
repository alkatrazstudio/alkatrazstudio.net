    Welcome to the Alkatraz Studio homepage!!
</p>
<p>
    Alkatraz Studio is a one man army that consists only of yours truly,
    Alexey Parfenov (rus: Алексей Парфёнов).
    I'm a software programmer from Russia.
    On this website you can find my projects that are decent enough
    to show them to a general audience.
    Mostly, these projects are multimedia and system applications and libraries.
</p>
<p>
    The theme of this website is inspired by
    <ExtLink href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ZX_Spectrum">ZX Spectrum</ExtLink>
    and
    <ExtLink href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TR-DOS">TR-DOS</ExtLink>.
</p>
<p>
    To save you some eye damage the ZX Spectrum fonts are used by default only in the menus.
    You can also change the fonts in the <NuxtLink to="/settings">Settings</NuxtLink>.
    The speccy font was found
    <ExtLink href="https://zx-pk.ru/threads/14785-russkij-ttf-shrift-kak-na-spektrume.html?p=348597&amp;viewfull=1#post348597">here</ExtLink>.
</p>
<p>
    The site can be operated using a keyboard only,
    but the browser window needs to be in focus
    (e. g. you may need to click inside the window for a keyboard to work).
    The site can also be comfortably viewed without JavaScript enabled
    or in text-only browsers.
</p>
<p>
    If you want to contact me regarding any of my projects then
    consider the following:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>If the project is no longer maintained (i.e. archived) then forget about it.</li>
    <li>
        If you want to file an issue or make a suggestion regarding an active project,
        then use the appropriate issue tracker on the project's homepage,
        or use a corresponding forum if applicable.
    </li>
    <li>
        If none of the above applies then as a last resort
        you may contact me via email:
        <MailTo scramble="yyde?bkl`uqbytsvcjn/mfs"/>.
    </li>
</ul>
