    GotText is a translation engine for PHP 7.
    It can be used instead of gettext, but it's not a drop-in replacement.
    The main goal of this project is to build a translation engine
    with gettext features but without any gettext shortcomings.
    GotText solves most of the fundamental problems of using gettext in PHP
    and also has an extra functionality on top.
</p>
<p>
    GotText is fully
    <ExtLink href="https://alkatrazstudio.gitlab.io/gottext/api/">documented</ExtLink>
    and can be built at least on Debian, Ubuntu and CentOS.
</p>
<p>
    Binary releases for Ubuntu can be found
    <ExtLink href="https://github.com/alkatrazstudio/gottext/releases">here</ExtLink>.
