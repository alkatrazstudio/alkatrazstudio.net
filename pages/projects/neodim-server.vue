<p>
    An HTTP-server that provides natural language text generation using a selected language model.
</p>
<p>
    This is basically an HTTP-wrapper around some of the existing language models on Hugging Face.
    Most of these models are on
    <ExtLink href="https://huggingface.co/models?library=pytorch&amp;pipeline_tag=text-generation&amp;sort=downloads">Hugging Face</ExtLink>.
    The project also includes a simple HTML page to test the server.

    Inspired by various "AI Dungeon"-like projects.
