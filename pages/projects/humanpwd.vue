    humanpwd generates several passwords that consist of four words each.
    The passwords will only contain lower-case English words without numbers, special symbols, etc.
    Based on the idea from the popular
    <ExtLink href="https://xkcd.com/936/">XKCD comic</ExtLink>.
</p>
<p>
    There were already some password generators based on that idea,
    but most of them are over-engineered and will only give you one password at a time.
    humanpwd is much simpler and straightforward.

    and as a <ExtLink href="https://github.com/alkatrazstudio/humanpwd/releases">stand-alone binary</ExtLink>.
